Install expo cli 

make sure you are running node 12.0 or higher

node -v 

install expo cli 

npm i -g expo-cli 

install expo client on your phone 

we can run our app on a physical device 

Create our expo project 

expo init <yourapp>

select blank (managed workflow) expo is creating everything behind the scenes 

when complete open your app folder I used VSS code 

Open the App.js file 

Go to this line in the code 

export default function App() {

and change the text here to say this:

<Text>React Native Test</Text>

in the terminal window run 

npm start 

THis will load metro bundler and a tab in your browser 

NOTE: on my machine the metro bundler loaded on http://localhost:19002/ but the port may vary on your system

Open android studio (you can run on an ios simulator but you need to have xcode installed)

click on configure->AVD Manager if you don't have any virtual devices configured you can create one 

I always pick the latest one which in my case was a Pixel 3a API 28. 3a has the google play store.

Under the tab actions you can click the green button to start the emulator 

Now go back to the web page that loaded the metro bundler and click on 'Run on Android Device/emulator'

Follow the rollbar steps to add rollbar to your react native app.
